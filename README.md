# simple-comment-app
The little project is implementing a simple comment section system using django, drf and launched via docker
To launch it locally you'll have to build a docker image for the application named "comment_app"
After that the databases can be launched locally via the docker-compose.yml with the application
The application is, as said before, a simple comment section system, where you can leave a comment, and have an infinite number of comments to it
There is no real authentication here, as normally you would need to implement a password for it
When leaving a comment you also have to leave your email and name
